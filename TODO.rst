TODO
====

- Add functions related to solving captchas.
- Find some website that uses a puzzle captcha, so I can test it.
- Should we prettify the dictionaries that the service's API returns? 
  Many of the keys are complete nonsense and totally not 
  self-explanatory and the devs are *not* good at documenting things.
- Add a CLI-application?
- Find a replacement for ``gitchangelog``
